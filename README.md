## Overview
This project is a CUDA-based path tracer designed to efficiently simulate realistic lighting in 3D scenes by tracing rays and evaluating their interactions with different materials. It focuses on optimizing performance through techniques like path segment sorting and stream compaction. The path tracer also includes features such as anti-aliasing, refraction with Fresnel effects, and efficient path termination, ensuring both high visual fidelity and fast rendering times.

## Description

### Feature 1: Shading Kernel with BSDF Evaluations
The shading kernel computes light interactions at each ray-surface intersection using Bidirectional Scattering Distribution Functions (BSDF). The Ideal Diffuse simulates surfaces that scatter light uniformly in all directions with cosine-weighted scattering. The perfectly specular is a mirror like surface which reflects light perfectly based on the incident angle.

| Ideal Diffuse      | Perfectly Specular |
|:------------------:|:----------------:|

### Feature 2: Antialiasing with stochastic sampled
Anti-aliasing can be achieved by jittering ray directions slightly at each pixel and averaging the results to make the image looks smoother and more natural. According to the image, the edge of the sphere smooth out, as we turn on the anti aliasing.

| Anti-Aliased       | Non-Anti-Aliased |

### Feature 3: Refraction
Implements refraction using Snell's Law with Fresnel effects for realistic materials like glass and water as procedural textures. Different Index of Refraction (IOR) values can be applied to simulate various transparent materials:
#### Glass: IOR = 1.55

- scene: glass.json

#### Different iors results: IOR = 1.55, 1.33, 1.31, 2.42
![](./img/iors.png)
- scene: iors.json

### Feature 4: Physically-based depth of field
Depth of field is to simulate the real life camera lens. By changeing the focal length and aperture value, it makes objects outside the focus range appear blurred.

- scene: dof.json
- Focal Length: 11
- Aperture: 0.03

### Feature 5: Arbitrary obj mesh loading and rendering 
This feature enables the loading of complex 3D models from OBJ files to your scene. By simply adding "OBJ" in the JSON file, you can load models and assign materials to them.

### Feature 6: Texture mapping and bump mapping
Supports both file-loaded textures and procedural textures. The following image shows the comparision Between with normal mapping and without normal mapping.

#### Comparison between file-loaded textures AND a basic procedural texture
For a simple scene, a basic procedural texture may only provide a slight performance improvement. However, as the resolution and number of file-loaded textures increase, the performance benefit of using procedural textures would become more noticeable, becuase the performance overhead of file I/O and memory access becomes more significant.

    - meshProcedural(basic procedural texture): 23.3 FPS
    - meshTex(file loaded textures): 23.1 FPS
    - meshTexNorm(file loaded textures and bump map): 22.9 FPS
- Scene: cornellCube.json

### Feature 7: Environment Mapping
To test environment mapping, stream compaction needs to be disabled. This is because stream compaction stops rays that don't intersect any objects, which prevents them from sampling the environment map in the direction they are pointing.

- Condition: #define STREAM_COMPACTION 0; #define ENVIRONMENT_MAP 1

### Feature 8: Path continuation/termination using Stream Compaction
Stream compaction is an important optimization technique in path tracing. It helps to remove inactives rays from further processing. The following chart represents a 55% imrovement in performamce with stream compaction.
#### Stream Compaction Chart

    - Stream Compaction: 35.2 FPS
- Scene: cornell.json
- Condition: #define STREAM_COMPACTION 0 & 1 (pathtrace.cu)

#### Num of rays and Depth
This image shows the number of active rays after each bounce in the path tracing with stream compaction enabled. Stream compaction is crucial in reducing computational load by terminating rays that are no longer useful, which is 'when the ray's remaining bounce = 0'.

### Feature 9: Sorting by material type to get contiguous in memory
Sorting rays/path segments by material type ensures that all rays interacting with the same material are processed together, which reduces memory divergence and improving efficiency in the shading kernel. This is especially useful in complex scenes with multiple materials as it increase the coherency and reduces memory access. In the example chart, as we are using the a simple scene, the performances decreases after material sorting, which is likely. It is because there's overhead of using material sorting outweighs the benefits. As the scene becomes more complex, the benefits are going to outweight the material sorting.

#### Sort material Chart

    - Original(Without Material Sorting or Stream Compaction): 22.7 FPS
    - Stream Compaction: 35.2 FPS
    - Material Sort: 5.6 FPS
    - Material Sort with Stream Compaction: 12 FPS
- Scene: cornell.json
- Condition: #define SORTMATERIAL 0 & 1 #define STREAM_COMPACTION 0 & 1 (pathtrace.cu)

### Feature 10: Russian Roulette
This feature terminates less important rays early in the path tracing process.The following chart shows that Russian roulette terminates rays that are unlikely to contribute to the final image and reduces the computational load slightly. The close scene is slower than open scene is because rays tend to bounce more times in close scene.

## Instruction
- Scenes Selection: All the scenes are stored in the scene directory. You can call the scene by setting JSON file path "../scenes/sceneName.json" in the Debugging > Command Arguments section in the Project Properties.
- Change the following define to test the features
- BVH is partially working from certain angles but doesn't work as expected.
```
#define BVH 0 // Unfinished DO NOT USE
#define ENVIRONMENT_MAP 1
#define STREAM_COMPACTION 1 // If use environment map, set to 0
#define SORTMATERIAL 1
#define RUSSIAN_ROULETTE 0
#define ANTI_ALIASING 1
